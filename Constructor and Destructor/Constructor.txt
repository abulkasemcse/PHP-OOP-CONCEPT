What is Constructor?
Constructor is a type of a member function of the class in PHP. Constructors are a critical part of classes as they act as a blueprint to create objects of the class. Unlike other member functions, a constructor does not need to be called. It gets automatically called once you create the object

PHP offers three types of constructors:

Default Constructor: Default constructors do not accept an argument. You can pass the values to default constructors dynamically.
Parameterised Constructor: These constructors accept arguments and can also pass values to the data members.
Copy Constructor: Copy constructors take addresses of the other objects as arguments.
